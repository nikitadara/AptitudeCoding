To check whether a year is leap or not

Step 1:

We first divide the year by 4.
If it is not divisible by 4 then it is not a leap year.
If it is divisible by 4 leaving remainder 0 
Step 2:

We divide the year by 100
If it is not divisible by 100 then it is a leap year.
If it is divisible by 100 leaving remainder 0
Step 3:

We divide the year by 400
If it is not divisible by 400 then it is a leap year.
If it is divisible by 400 leaving remainder 0 
Then it is a leap year


Code:
Java:->
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//scanner class declaration
                Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		//input year from user
		System.out.println("Enter a Year");
		int year = sc.nextInt();
		//condition for checking year entered by user is a leap year or not
                if((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0)
                        System.out.println(year + " is a leap year.");
		else
			System.out.println(year + " is not a leap year.");
        }
}

C++:->
#include<stdio.h>
using namespace std;
//main program
int main()
{
	//initialising variables
	int year;
	cout<<"Enter year to check: ";
	//user input
	cin>>year;
	//checking for leap year
	if( ((year % 4 == 0)&&(year % 100 != 0)) || (year % 400==0) )
	{
		//input is a leap year
		cout<<year<<" is a leap year";
	}
	else
	{
		//input is not a leap year
		cout<<year<< " is not a leap year";
	}
	return 0;
}
