Write a program to take input a line from stdin. You have to reverse every word of this line, except for the starting and ending line of the words. For example, for the following input:

we love coding in this world
the output is:

we lveo cnidog in tihs wlrod
every word has been reversed except it's first and last alphabet.
Input format:

first line contains the number of lines, n
this is followed by n lines
Output:

print each line such that the words are reversed as per the criteria above
Example Input:
5
hello all
this is a good
example
to show you how to reverse
a string
 
Output:
hlleo all 
tihs is a good 
elpmaxe 
to sohw you how to rsrevee 
a snirtg

Code:
def reverseWord(Str):
    i = 1
    j = len(Str) - 2
    while (i < j):

        temp = Str[i]
        Str[i] = Str[j]
        Str[j] = temp
        i += 1
        j -= 1

    return "".join(Str)

def reverseWords(Str):
    Str = Str.split()
    for i in Str:
        j = [h for h in i]
        print(reverseWord(j), end = " ")

n=int(input())
for i in range (0,n):
    Str=input()
    reverseWords(Str)
    print()
